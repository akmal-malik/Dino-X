    <p>
      The <strong>Brachiosaurus</strong> was one of the largest and tallest dinosaurs 
      that lived during the late Jurassic period, around 154 to 150 million years ago. 
      It was known for its long neck, small head, and front legs that were longer than its back legs, 
      giving it a giraffe-like posture.

      <h3>Some Facts About Brachiosaurus:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>It could reach up to 85 feet in length and weigh as much as 62 tons.</li>
        <li>Its long neck helped it reach leaves from tall trees that other herbivores couldn’t eat.</li>
        <li>Brachiosaurus had nostrils located on top of its head.</li>
        <li>It was a gentle giant that lived in herds for protection and social behavior.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>
      Scientists believe that Brachiosaurus played a major role in shaping its ecosystem by feeding 
      on high vegetation. Its towering height and massive size made it one of the most impressive 
      creatures of the Jurassic period and a symbol of dinosaurian grandeur.
